    "1. I've taken an introductory Python course at a community college during middle school, so it was interesting see how my brain felt familar with some of the concepts. I've taken AP Computer Science A during my sophomore year, so I also saw some overlap, but I'm grateful I had the experience so I wasn't completely new to programming. However, I definitely did feel like I was going into this course without prior knowledge. This course has definitely refreshed my knowledge in Python, and I learned more than I expected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I went above and beyond with this project because I took an existing Assignment project and changed it to make it my own.I have ten functions, many of which are elaborate. Even though I've spent hours on end debugging my code, even losing my entire functions file at some point (I had to stare out the window for a good five minutes to come to terms with this reality), I learned a lot of other coding concepts just from research alone.
